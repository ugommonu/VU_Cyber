In this activity, you will continue to play the role of a security analyst at Acme Corp. 

- CompuCom has requested that you analyze a packet capture of a SYN Scan it ran against one of its hosts. 

- You must determine what ports are open, closed, and filtered.

### Instructions
1. Open the packet capture provided to you.

2. Based on the host responses, determine which ports are open, closed, or filtered.
   
3. Write a short summary of your findings. 

   - _Note: A general summary of the filtered ports is fine, as the list of filtered ports is large._
